# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This project was made as an introduction to the coding bootcamp I will be learning from in the coming months! I built this project in order to gain more of a foundational understanding of some of the more basic concepts that will be needed to succeed within this course, as well as some much needed practice in more difficult areas, such as the command line. It helped me solve some of the more complicated areas of the command line basics, which I was really struggling with at first. It also taught me a bit more about HTML and CSS that I had not quite learned yet. Javascript is still completely foreign to me, but it is something for me to work hard to master!

## Installation

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

This Prework-Study-Guide has a multitude of uses for me, including general touch ups on some of the basics I learned throughout this prework module, to prepare me for the real deal! I can go back to this cheat sheet when i'm struggling, or even to make sure i'm still on top of my learning if things get slow. I will be sure to add to this site as class begins and continue to update it with what I have learned, including making the site much more visually pleasing! It will be my testing ground for new ideas learned. I'll mostly come back to view my notes within the git section, as that is definitely the hardest for me!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
